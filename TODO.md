# To Do

## Flexible file names

So you can tweak them when they finally figure out what's happening

## Slow-drip connection

Similar to the word stream, but with bytes

## Crawler Honeytrap

- Random (but deterministic) generated content
- internal links between content

## JSONP

JSON callbacks that will slow their browsers to a crawl.  Or a crypto-miner.

## Bombs

- [ ] [XML/YAML bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack)
- [ ] Regex
- [ ] Zip - Tiny ZIP files that uncompress into disk-filling behemoths.

## Images

- [ ] random uncompressable static, in custom sizes (like the placeholder sites)
- [ ] rude hand gestures
- [ ] images: rotten apple images for apple icons
- [ ] risque bookplates (I'm too classy for actual porn)
