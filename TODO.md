These are things that I've though of but haven't implemented yet.  Feel free to contribute!

## Flexible file names

So you can tweak them when they finally figure out what's happening

## GIF stream

Animated GIF that never stops

* [gif-stream](https://github.com/devongovett/gif-stream)

## Endless Redirects

* Redirect (after a pause)
* Permanent or temporary (permanent might fill up something on the client)
* Occasional HTML redirect to avoid "too many redirects" error

## Slow-drip connection

Similar to the word stream, but with bytes

## Crawler Honeytrap

* Random (but deterministic) generated content
* internal links between content

## JSONP

JSON callbacks that will slow their browsers to a crawl.  Or a crypto-miner.

## Bombs

* [XML/YAML bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack)
* Regex
* Zip - Tiny ZIP files that uncompress into disk-filling behemoths.

## Images

* random uncompressable static, in custom sizes (like the placeholder sites)
* rude hand gestures
* images: rotten apple images for apple icons
* risque bookplates (I'm too classy for actual porn)
