		<h3>What is this?</h3>
		<p>
			Several different ways of getting back at people that use your resources without your permission.
			Nothing does any permanent damage, and I aim to keep it mildly safe-for-work.

		<h3>Why?</h3>
		<p>Someone distributed their software with a call to my website that
		was essentially a distributed denial of service (DDoS).  I had no way to contact them
		and no way to stop them.  I was powerless.  Returning invalid content or an error did not help.
		I finally started returning huge results in a feeble attempt to at least annoy them a little bit.</p>

		<h3>Did it work?</h3>
		<p>Well, they eventually stopped.  I never had any contact with them, so I don't know the actual
			reason they stopped.</p>

		<h3>Can I count on you?</h3>
		<p>Heh.  Downtime and invalid responses are a <i>feature</i> as far as I am concerned.</p>

		<h3>Any future plans?</h3>
		<p>I'm a vindictive sort of person, so I've brooded about all sorts of nasty things to do. See
			the <a href="https://github.com/FreeloaderWTF/www.freeloader.wtf/blob/master/TODO.md">TODO file</a> for some of them.</p>
		<p>However, I don't have a pressing need for them at the moment, so I'm not actively working on any of them.  
			You are welcome to contribute!
